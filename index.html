<p style="color:white"><b>Hello</b> today i'm going to tell you what I've done to my Arduino UNO, it is very interesting. I did the arduino 3 days ago.</p>
<p>
<pre style="color:white">
What you need is:
Arduino UNO With ports(You will oftenly get the ports).(If you do not have uno you have to  have a anolog side on the Arduino).
Arduino's packs breadboard.
Arduino's USB.
Arduino's sketch on computer.
resister.
circit from the Arduino's box.
Light Arduino's box | packet.

<p style="color:white">First I written a code.</p>
<br>
<pre>
<code style="color:green">
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}

<p style="color:white"><b>BUT </b>It affects the Arduino not the bread board that is connected. </p>
<br>
<p style="color:white">There's a link if you'd want to skip the webpage and watch. Here it is. </p>
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7DY2UbHvM">Over here</a>
<br>
<p style="color:white">Take the circit and connect it to to v5(It's on the analog side)</p>
<br>
<p style="color:white">then there is a - and + on the breadboard put the connected circit to the - so the circit is connected.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:white">Then take the resister and put it from the + to not the -, after the + that is where you put the end of the resister. </p>
<br>
<p style="color:white">then put the light horizontal right of the resister then take s circit put it to the - side it has to bi horizontal to the - then take another circut and put it from the - to gnd(analog side) and the code that is on top of the page also write it in the arduino sketch</p>
<br>
<p style="color:white">That's all folks</p>
