### I am a highschool student that has good experience in the field of programming.
Since I was a kid, I always had the knack for solving problems. Around the age of 10, I started to look into programming and computer Science. Since then I have been working on small projects, such as simple webscrapers and small mini-games. I mainly used to program in C. Here I would create projects like small IDEs, file readers and _as a matter of fact_ my own desktop program. I also found the structure of the linux operating system quite interesting. Although I wasn't an expert on it (still am not), I would always read about how processes and the linux kernel work together.

Now I have taken an interest in Machine Learning and Game Development. Although I am new to the field of AI, I have still managed to make some impressive projects.
1. Classifying handdrawn numbers from MNIST using a softmax classifier
2. Identifying brain tumors using CNNs
3. (Currently a work in progress) Predicting the future value of a cryptocurrency based on its 7-day track-history.

The projects mentioned above are of my latest achievements in the field of AI. The first project was a field study on how linear neural networks _work_. Here I wrote a paper, which consisted of 20 pages of pure content, on how linear classifiers work mathematically and how to implement them using frameworks like PyTorch. And yes, I managed to impress my teacher quite well.
