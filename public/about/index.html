<p>Since I was a kid, I always had the knack for solving problems. Around the age of 10, I started to look into programming and computer Science. Since then I have been working on small projects, such as simple webscrapers and small mini-games. I mainly used to program in C. Here I would create projects like small IDEs, file readers and <em>as a matter of fact</em> my own desktop program. I also found the structure of the linux operating system quite interesting. Although I wasn&rsquo;t an expert on it (still am not), I would always read about how processes and the linux kernel work together.</p>

<p>Now I have taken an interest in Machine Learning and Game Development. Although I am new to the field of AI, I have still managed to make some impressive projects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Classifying handdrawn numbers from MNIST using a softmax classifier</li>
<li>Identifying brain tumors using CNNs</li>
<li>(Currently a work in progress) Predicting the future value of a cryptocurrency based on its 7-day track-history.</li>
</ol>
<p>The projects mentioned above are of my latest achievements in the field of AI. The first project was a field study on how linear neural networks <em>work</em>. Here I wrote a paper, which consisted of 20 pages of pure content, on how linear classifiers work mathematically and how to implement them using frameworks like PyTorch. And yes, I managed to impress my teacher quite well.</p>
