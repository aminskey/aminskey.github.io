      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-a-highschool-student-that-has-good-experience-in-the-field-of-programming&#34;&gt;I am a highschool student that has good experience in the field of programming.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I was a kid, I always had the knack for solving problems. Around the age of 10, I started to look into programming and computer Science. Since then I have been working on small projects, such as simple webscrapers and small mini-games. I mainly used to program in C. Here I would create projects like small IDEs, file readers and &lt;em&gt;as a matter of fact&lt;/em&gt; my own desktop program. I also found the structure of the linux operating system quite interesting. Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t an expert on it (still am not), I would always read about how processes and the linux kernel work together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
